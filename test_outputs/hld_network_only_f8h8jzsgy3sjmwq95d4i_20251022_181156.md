## 6. Migration Approach

### Migration Phases

1. **Pre-Migration Assessment**
   - Validate source VM configurations
   - Verify destination cluster capacity
   - Test network connectivity

2. **Pilot Migration**
   - Select 5-10 non-critical VMs
   - Perform test migrations
   - Validate functionality

3. **Phased Production Migration**
   - Migrate in scheduled waves
   - Monitor performance
   - Rollback plan ready

4. **Post-Migration Validation**
   - Application testing
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Documentation updates

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Network connectivity issues | High | Medium | Pre-migration network testing and validation |
| Capacity constraints | High | Low | Oversubscription ratios and capacity monitoring |
| Application compatibility | Medium | Medium | Pilot migration and thorough testing |
| Data loss during migration | High | Low | Backup verification and rollback procedures |
| Extended downtime | Medium | Medium | Migration windows and phased approach |
