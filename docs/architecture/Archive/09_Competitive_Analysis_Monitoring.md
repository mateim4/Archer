### 1.2. Core Features & Capabilities
*   **Unified Monitoring:** Provides a single pane of glass for infrastructure, APM, logs, and security.
*   **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Tracks performance metrics for servers, containers, cloud platforms, and network devices.
*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Offers deep insights into application performance with distributed tracing.
*   **Log Management:** Centralizes, analyzes, and enriches log data.
*   **Synthetic Monitoring:** Simulates user interactions and API calls to test uptime and performance.
*   **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** Tracks user interactions to improve performance and user experience.
*   **Security Monitoring:** Helps identify vulnerabilities and detect threats.
*   **Dashboards and Alerting:** Highly customizable real-time dashboards and powerful alerting capabilities.
*   **Integrations:** Boasts over 600 integrations with various services and platforms.
*   **AI/ML Capabilities:** Incorporates AIOps for anomaly detection and forecasting.

### 1.3. Pricing Model
Datadog's pricing is modular and usage-based. Key factors influencing cost include:
*   Number of monitored hosts
*   Log retention period
*   Volume of data ingested
*   Number of custom metrics
*   Usage of advanced features like APM, RUM, and Synthetics

**Example Costs (billed annually, per month):**
*   **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Starts at $15 per host.
*   **APM:** Starts at $31 per host.
*   **Log Management:** Starts at $0.10 per GB for indexed logs.
*   **Synthetic Monitoring:** API tests start at $5 per 10,000 runs.
*   **RUM:** Starts at $1.50 per 1,000 sessions.

## 2. New Relic

### 2.1. Overview
New Relic is a powerful observability platform that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for monitoring and optimizing the entire software stack. It is a strong competitor to Datadog, offering a similar all-in-one approach. New Relic has recently shifted its pricing model to be more predictable and value-driven, based on data usage and user type, which has been well-received.

### 2.2. Core Features & Capabilities
*   **Full-Stack Observability:** Provides a unified platform for APM, infrastructure monitoring, log management, and digital experience monitoring.
*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Deep performance insights, distributed tracing, and error tracking.
*   **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Monitoring for hosts, Kubernetes, networks, and serverless environments.
*   **Log Management:** Centralized log collection, analysis, and alerting.
*   **Synthetics Monitoring:** Proactive monitoring by simulating user interactions.
*   **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** End-user experience monitoring for web and mobile applications.
*   **AI-Powered Insights (AIOps):** AI-driven anomaly detection, predictive alerting, and root cause analysis.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Helps identify and mitigate security risks.

### 2.3. Pricing Model
New Relic's pricing is based on two main factors: data ingest and billable users.
*   **Data Ingest:**
    *   **Free Tier:** 100 GB of data ingest per month is free.
    *   **New Relic Data:** $0.30/GB for standard data ingest.
    *   **New Relic Data Plus:** $0.50/GB for advanced features like extended retention and compliance.
*   **User Types:**
    *   **Basic Users:** Unlimited free users with basic access.
    *   **Core Users:** Starting at $49/user per month for advanced developer tools.
    *   **Full Platform Users:** Starting at $99/user per month for comprehensive access. One full platform user is included for free.
