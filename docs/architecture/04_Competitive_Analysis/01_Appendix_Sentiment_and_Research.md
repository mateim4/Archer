## Comments

### USER SENTIMENT & FEATURE PAIN/DELIGHT (2024–2025)

#### Most Praised Features (G2, Gartner, Reddit, Twitter)
- Automation: Workflow/approval, auto-routing, and integrated runbooks are most often called "life-changing."
- Ease of Use: Clean onboarding, intuitive UI, search that "just works" noted especially for Freshservice, Zendesk, and modern Jira.
- Integrations: Ecosystem breadth and plug-ins for everything loved in ServiceNow, Jira, Okta, Device42.
- AI/Virtual Agents: When accurate, users praise time savings, but AI is only reliably valued at ServiceNow, Freshservice, and—emerging—Jira.
- Mobile Experience: Fast, real mobile apps distinguish midmarket tools (Zendesk) and Gen2 leaders; bad mobile = “shelfware.”
- Custom Reports/Analytics: Self-service insights, easy-to-construct dashboards valued by admins/leads.

#### Most Common Pain Points
- Complexity/UI Overload: Learning curves (ServiceNow, BMC, Snow, Splunk) and "too many clicks" are near-universal gripes.
- Pricing/Value: High cost cited as #1 negative for ServiceNow and most complete stacks. Zendesk seen as strong value for SMB.
- Integration Setup: "Promised" plug-and-play sometimes lags—ServiceNow, Device42, Dynatrace, and legacy IAM are called out.
- Performance/UI Speed: Slow interfaces (ServiceNow, BMC, old Snow) kill user satisfaction, especially on older enterprise deployments.
- API Documentation: Not all platforms document consistently; this blocks automation for some users.
- Customization Limits: Frustration if deep process config or edge workflow required (Zendesk, lower-tier Jira, Freshservice low-end plans).

#### Feature Gaps & Opportunities
- Unified Search: Cross-module/global search that spans tickets, assets, alerts, docs, and allows in-line action is rare—huge ask in reviews.
- No/Low-Code Automation: Users want deeper process automation without scripting, targeting ops leads, not devs.
- AI-Powered Root Cause: Gaps remain in real “explain why/how” for incident/alert root causes.
- Embedded KB/Docs: Real in-context knowledge surfacing (not just links) is still hard—delight for anyone who does it well.
- Mobile Admin: Most tools lack full-featured admin/analytics on mobile.
