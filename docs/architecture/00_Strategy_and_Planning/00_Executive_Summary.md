# Executive Summary - Archer ITSM Research

## Key Findings

### Market Opportunity: MASSIVE

No platform currently delivers:

* ITSM + CMDB + Monitoring unified natively
* Simple for SMB, powerful for enterprise
* Modern UI that's actually fast
* AI transparent and included
* Transparent all-in pricing
* Works great out-of-box

### Universal Pain Points (ALL Platforms)

1. COMPLEXITY (#1 complaint)
   * ServiceNow: Requires 4+ dedicated admins, months to implement
   * Jira: Fragmented configuration
2. HIDDEN COSTS (Real costs 2-3x advertised)
   * ServiceNow: $90-200+/agent + add-ons
   * Jira: $2,250/mo real vs $1,000 advertised (50 agents)
3. SEPARATE PRODUCTS
   * ITSM + CMDB + Monitoring = 3 tools
   * Context lost, requires middleware
4. MISSING BASICS
   * Jira: Cannot merge tickets!
5. SLOW UIs
   * ServiceNow: "Way too slow literally everyday"

## Competitive Insights

**ServiceNow** (Leader, 28.8% market)

* Strengths: Comprehensive, 500+ integrations
* Weakness: Complexity, cost, slow UI
* Opportunity: Beat on simplicity

**Jira** (Growing, dev-first)

* Strengths: Atlassian ecosystem, AI included
* Weakness: Can't merge tickets, hidden costs
* Opportunity: Fix basics, better pricing

**Freshservice** (Rising, best UX - G2: 4.6/5)

* Strengths: Intuitive UI, Freddy AI (76% time reduction)
* Weakness: Reporting, doesn't scale past 500 agents
* Opportunity: Beat reporting, scale better

## Recommendations

### Positioning

"The Modern ServiceNow Alternative"

* Target: 50-1,000 agents
* Message: Enterprise capabilities without complexity

### Differentiation

1. Unified platform (ITSM+CMDB+Monitoring natively)
2. Simplicity by design
3. Transparent pricing (AI included)
4. Modern fast UI (Purple Glass)
5. Days to implement (not months)

### Pricing Strategy

* Starter: $29/agent
* Professional: $59/agent
* Enterprise: $99/agent
* 50-70% less than ServiceNow
* AI always included

## Next Steps

1. Validate findings with team
2. Finalize Phase 1 scope (MVP)
3. Build high-fidelity mockups
4. Technical POC (SurrealDB for CMDB)

**Full Research**:

* 327+ sources analyzed
* See: [[../04_Competitive_Analysis/00_Competitive_Analysis_Matrix.md]] and [[../04_Competitive_Analysis/01_Appendix_Sentiment_and_Research.md]] for full details.

## Comments

## Table Structure Confirmed – Research Now Being Populated

Documenting research findings, feature tables, user sentiment, AI/technical/UX analysis, and references in corresponding issues. Will iterate over each deliverable, inserting tables, diagrams, excerpts, and synthesized findings directly into Linear project until comprehensive reporting is achieved.

All evidence and sources will be cross-linked in the Appendix and relevant comparison sections.
